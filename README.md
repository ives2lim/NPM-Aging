## NPM Aging Study Github Code Dump
This is my first time using github. Please bear with me as I build this page.<br>

Singapore's National Precision Medicine (NPM) strategy seeks to acceleration biomedical research, improve health outcomes, and enhance opportunities for economic value across sectors through a decade long roadmap. The first phase of this strategy is a "proof of concept", through the SG10K health study - primarily generating a genomic reference database of 10,000 healthy Singaporeans, demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale genomic data generation. As part of SG10K health study, this study investigates the Ageing-related clinical phenotypes, alongside genetic, epigenetic, telomere length, and epigenetic clocks, to provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular landscape of Age-related phenotypes in an Asian multiethnic cohort.

This git repository houses the codes used for the analysis of the NPM Aging Study.
